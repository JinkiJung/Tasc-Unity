# Tasc-Unity: Unity implementation of Tasc
Tasc is a task script that describes and implements a procedure. Tasc aims to support easier implementation of a scenario and a procedural task such as tutorial, virtual reality based training, e-Learning, game, presentation, and simultation, through the unified structure of the task script. This repository provides an Unity package of Tasc.

## Download
[Tasc unitypackage v0.1.0](https://github.com/JinkiJung/Tasc-Unity/raw/master/Tasc0.1.0.unitypackage)

## Feature
- Easy, reusable (modular) implementation of a scenario
- Support of a sequential and conditional scenario flow
- Logging for user performance evaluation
- multi-platform support, currently a desktop and Steam VR
- Easy implementation of visual and audio guidance
- Windows and OSX support
- And itâ€™s free to use!

## A brief history

When [Jinki Jung](https://jinkijung.github.io/) and [Hyeopwoo Lee](https://github.com/orgs/VirtualityForSafety/people/opo6954) conducted researches on virtual training, they found out there are no generalized framework in procedure implementation even though it has huge impacts to various industry. The initial idea was to develop an authoring tool for converting the training scenario (mostly formed as a manuscript or dialogs) to an executable training program. Throughout their publications and researches they formerly invented PAUT (pairwise authoring tool) and ACTA (Actor-Condition-Terminus-Action). Jinki who is the inventor of Tasc, continues his path to unify those efforts and implement Tasc from scratch again to make it more generic and useful.
